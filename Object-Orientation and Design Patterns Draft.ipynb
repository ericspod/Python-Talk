    " * __Abstraction__: the details of how objects function are hidden from clients while still permitting use\n",
    " * __Inheritance__: object definitions can be stated as extensions of existing ones, assuming their members for reuse in the new type\n",

    " * __Polymorphism__: objects have multiple types, can have differing behaviour from what would be expected of one of these types \n",
    " * __Substitutability__: objects of a subtype should be substitutable with objects of the parent type while preserving correctness\n",
    " * __Patterns__: describe common design choices and good practices in a concise but generic architectural notion"

    "Object-orientation is a programming paradigm centered on the concept of encapsulating data with operations. In the simplest form, an object is a piece of data with associated routines which manipulate that data. Object-oriented systems are composed of many objects aggregating together to form structures and cooperate in implementing a program's behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "This contrasts with imperative languages like Fortran or C which are composed of routines and data defined separately as global or local variables. Here there is a loose relationship between data and the code that manipulates it, and the structure of the code is much less flexible or reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures and their associated code are defined as abstract data types (ADTs) which are composed of a definition for a data entity and routines which manipulate such entities. For example, a `Dimension` type in C to represent a 2D area:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "struct Dimension { int width,height; }\n",
    "void init(struct Dimension* d, int w, int h);\n",
    "int area(struct Dimension* d);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract component of this ADT is evident in that the data entity and its routines are declared without being befined. \n",
    "A client can still use this ADT without knowing the details of its implementation; abstraction is an important property to ensure a separation of concerns and modularity in code.\n",
    "This however defines a weak link between the data entity `Dimension` and the routines, as well as creating a definition which cannot be changed or adapted in client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming aims to make the connection between data and code tighter and explicit while preserving abstraction. Objects are instances of ADTs which encapsulate data and routines in one entity, as demonstrated in the C++ equivalent of the above:\n",

The idea with inheritance is that the subtype is a __specialization__ of the supertype, it represents a related concept that is more refined or specific to a particular context. In our example, a rectangle has a notion of dimension as well as location and so is a special type of dimension. Other subtypes of `Dimension` could be defined which represent some other specialization but which has no relation to `Rect`. Classes can also inherit from multiple supertypes, thus should be thought of as being specialization of multiple concepts at once.\n",

This states that substituting an instance of a type in an algorithm with an instance of a subtype should not affect the algorithm's correctness.

In our example, `calcsquare()` should function correctly with an instance of `Dimension` or one of `Rect`.\n",

This demonstrates that an inherited method is not hard wired to the methods defined in the superclass but instead access override methods. Python and other OO languages make extensive use of this in types whose behaviour is deliberately designed to be modified in subtypes, although the semantics of different languages vary. This is a reuse mechanism since these types can define algorithms or data structures in a way that allows them to be adapted to other applications without being rewritten. The principle of substitution factors into this process, dictating that such subtypes should be defined in a semantically substitutable way, otherwise clients reliant on the expected behaviour will not necessarily operate correctly. \n",

    " * __Interface Types__: Java and C# have a notion of an interface type which defines only method signatures. These are unnecessary due to duck typing in Python.\n",
