# Python-Talk
Apr 2016 KCL Python talk presentation slides

These are my slides for the presentation defined as a Jupyter notebook with the RISE package for slides. 

This can be viewed online as a presentation at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ericspod/Python-Talk/blob/master/Presentation.ipynb (click the "View as Slides" button). You can view Presentation.ipynb in Github without this but it displays as a long notebook rather than slides.

To view on your local machine:
 1. Download the whole repository as a zip file
 2. Install Jupyter (ie. install Anaconda) and https://github.com/damianavila/RISE
 3. Start the IPython Notebook with the icon or with the command "ipython notebook"
 
Your browser should open up at http://localhost:8888/tree and serve files from the current location, or in Windows create a directory "Documents/IPython Notebooks" and serve from there. Copy the zip contents somewhere (or to "IPython Notebooks" in Windows), navigate there in the web form, and then click Presentation.ipynb.

Anaconda can be gotten from https://www.continuum.io/downloads This is just a packaging of the Python interpreter and a large collection of scientific, mathematical, statistical, and other modules, specifically including numpy, scipy, Spyder, and matplotlib. If you want these packages with the Python distribution you've already got then using a package manager (such as pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ or apt-get in Linux) otherwise you'll have to install them manually.
