# Python-Talk
Apr 2016 KCL Python talk presentation slides

This can be viewed online as a presentation at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ericspod/Python-Talk/blob/master/Presentation.ipynb (click the "View as Slides" button). You can view Presentation.ipynb in Github without this but it displays as a long notebook rather than slides.

To view on your machine, download the whole repository as a zip file, install Jupyter (ie. install Anaconda) and https://github.com/damianavila/RISE, and start the IPython Notebook with the icon or with the command "ipython notebook". Your browser should open up at http://localhost:8888/tree and serve files from the current location, or in Windows create a directory "Documents/IPython Notebooks" and serve from there. Copy the zip contents somewhere (or to "IPython Notebooks" in Windows), navigate there in the web form, and then click Presentation.ipynb.
