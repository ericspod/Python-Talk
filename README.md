# Python-Talk
Apr 2016 KCL Python talk presentation slides

This can be viewed online as a presentation at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ericspod/Python-Talk/blob/master/Presentation.ipynb (click the "View as Slides" button). You can view Presentation.ipynb in Github without this but it displays as a long notebook rather than slides.

To view on your machine, download the whole repository as a zip file and unzip it somewhere, install Jupyter (ie. install Anaconda) and https://github.com/damianavila/RISE, start the IPython Notebook with the icon or with the command "ipython notebook". Your browser should open up at http://localhost:8888/tree, from there navigate to where you unzipped the presentation and then click Presentation.ipynb.
