# Python-Talk

These are my presentation slides defined as Jupyter notebooks (with the RISE package for slides).

### PythonScientific.ipynb: Apr 2016 KCL Python talk presentation slides
The talk will cover the basics of the Python language, from syntax to objects and a few of the common features you'll encounter. Further, I'll address the mathematical and scientific libraries most relevant to transitioning your code and development process away from Matlab and into Python. This will include the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries and how they relate to their equivalents in Matlab. The talk shall also cover the development environments available to use these libraries with, and how they replace the functionality provided by the Matlab environment. This talk assumes a good understanding of coding concepts (specifically in Matlab) and should leave you with sufficient knowledge of Python to start using it for scientific coding now.

### Viewing
The first set of slides can be viewed online as a presentation at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ericspod/Python-Talk/blob/master/PythonScientific.ipynb (click the "View as Slides" button which looks like a gift-wrapped box for some reason). You can view PythonScientific.ipynb in Github without this but it displays as a long notebook rather than slides.

To view on your local machine:
 1. Download the whole repository as a zip file
 2. Install Jupyter (ie. install Anaconda since it's included) and install https://github.com/damianavila/RISE as per that page's instructions
 3. Start the IPython Notebook with the icon or with the command "ipython notebook"
 4. Your browser should open up at __http://localhost:8888/tree__ and serve files from the current location, or in Windows creates a directory "Documents/IPython Notebooks" and serve from there. Copy the zip contents somewhere (or to "IPython Notebooks" in Windows), navigate there in the web form, and then click PythonScientific.ipynb.

Anaconda can be had from https://www.continuum.io/downloads This is just a packaging of the Python interpreter and a large collection of scientific, mathematical, statistical, and other modules, specifically including numpy, scipy, Spyder, IPython and matplotlib. If you want these packages with the Python distribution you've already got then using a package manager (such as pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ or apt-get in Linux) is a good idea, otherwise you'll have to install them manually.
